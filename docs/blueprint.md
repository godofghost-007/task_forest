# **App Name**: Task Forest

## Core Features:

- Dashboard UI: Display the main dashboard screen with a 2x3 grid of circular task items.
- Tree Growth Progress: Show tree growth progress based on task completion with inspirational quotes.
- Isometric Forest View: Display an isometric 3D forest village view that evolves as tasks are completed.
- Task Addition Modal: Enable task addition through a modal with options to link to health data or create custom tasks.
- Integration of screens: Integrate the Task dashboard screen, Tree Growth Progress, Forest and Profile management within the app using tab navigation

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant orange (#FF8000) that evokes energy and motivation, subtly desaturated for the background.
- Background color: Light beige (#FAF0E6), a very desaturated and bright tint of orange, providing a soft and natural feel.
- Accent color: A soft green (#8FBC8F) provides a complementary contrast for completed tasks and growth elements.
- Font pairing: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headlines, lending a modern and geometric touch. 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text to keep a balance of modern and warm style.
- Use a consistent set of icons from a single source that follow the design language of 'Material Design' which aligns well with React Native UI and will provide the user a feeling of well known usage patterns, making them intuitively grasp the usage of each visual affordance.
- Implement a responsive grid-based layout for the task dashboard to accommodate different screen sizes.
- Incorporate smooth transitions and micro-interactions to enhance user engagement, using libraries like React Native Reanimated.
